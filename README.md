Project Overview
The Treasure Hunt Web Application was developed to provide users with an engaging and challenging experience that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The project was led by an individual developer who played a key role in designing both the frontend and backend components of the application.

Frontend Development: The frontend of the application was designed using HTML and CSS to create visually appealing and user-friendly pages. The layout and design were carefully crafted to enhance the user experience and provide intuitive navigation.

Backend Development: Django, a high-level Python web framework, was utilized for the backend development of the application. The developer implemented server-side scripting to manage user authentication, handle clues and stages, and track user progress throughout the treasure hunt.
